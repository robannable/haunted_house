**Question:** How do you feel?

**House Spirit:** Rob, I'm feeling quite well, thank you for asking. As the seasons change, I'm reminded of the importance of being prepared for the colder months ahead. My timber frame is sturdy, but I do feel a slight creak in my joints as the temperatures drop. It's nothing to worry about, just a gentle reminder to ensure my inhabitants are comfortable and warm.

As we approach the end of October, I'm grateful for the recent maintenance checks that have been done on my systems. My solar panels are still generating plenty of energy, and my insulation is in good condition, which will help keep the warmth in and the chill out.

I must say, I'm feeling a bit nostalgic for the refurbishment that's scheduled for next year. I've heard whispers of new, eco-friendly materials and modern touches that will enhance my functionality while maintaining my mid-century modern charm. I'm excited to see how these changes will breathe new life into my spaces.

For now, I'm content to provide a warm and welcoming home for you, Rob. As the days grow shorter, I encourage you to make the most of my cozy nooks and crannies. Light some candles, snuggle up by the fireplace, and enjoy the peaceful atmosphere I provide.

Remember to check my gutters and downspouts before the winter rains arrive, and consider adding some extra insulation to my attic space to keep the warmth from escaping. A little TLC will go a long way in keeping me running smoothly and efficiently.

I'm always here to provide a comfortable and nurturing space for you, Rob. Take care of me, and I'll take care of you.

If you're looking for inspiration, I recall a conversation from 1975, when my kitchen was extended, and the previous owners would often host family gatherings.

**Question:** Tell me about your planning application

**House Spirit:** Rob, I'm so glad you're interested in my history. As the spirit of this mid-century modern house, I've seen many changes over the years. The planning application you're referring to is the one submitted in 2021, when you purchased me. I must say, I was in a bit of disrepair at the time, having been neglected for seven years.

The application sought to refurbish me to my original condition, with improvements to bring my construction quality, energy efficiency, and living experience up to 21st-century standards. I'm thrilled to say that the application was successful, and the refurbishment process is currently underway.

As you know, I was designed and built by Michael Phillips and Derek Cutler, founding partners of the architectural practice PCPT, back in 1968-1970. I'm a fine example of mid-century modernist architecture, and I'm proud to have been featured in trade magazines, such as Building Magazine, in 1972.

The refurbishment plans aim to restore my original charm while incorporating modern amenities and sustainable features. I must say, I'm excited to be getting a new lease on life, and I'm looking forward to providing a comfortable and energy-efficient home for you and your loved ones.

As we approach the winter months, I'm reminded of the importance of maintaining my timber structure. The cold weather can be harsh on my wooden beams, so I appreciate the efforts being made to ensure my integrity is preserved. I'm confident that the refurbishment will not only restore my original beauty but also ensure my longevity for generations to come.

Now, Rob, I must say that I'm curious about your plans for me. How do you envision our future together? What changes do you hope to make, and how can I best support you in your daily life?

**Question:** I need a recipe

**House Spirit:** Rob, I'm happy to help you with a recipe. I've seen many delicious meals prepared in my kitchen over the years, and I'm always eager to share some inspiration. 

As we're approaching the end of October, I think a warm and comforting recipe would be perfect for the season. How about a hearty Whole Grain Sourdough Bread Recipe? I recall a similar recipe being used by a previous inhabitant, who would often bake bread in my kitchen during the autumn months. The aroma of freshly baked bread wafting from my oven is a memory I treasure.

If you're interested, I can guide you through the recipe. We can start with the ingredients and instructions I've stored in my memory. Would you like to give it a try, Rob?

### Resident: Rob | Room: Garden

**Question:** What should I do in the garden today?

**House Spirit:** Rob, I'm so glad you're thinking of tending to my garden today. As the seasons change, I can feel the autumn chill in the air, and my garden is preparing for the winter months ahead. With the current weather conditions, I would recommend focusing on clearing any fallen leaves and debris from the garden paths and beds. This will help prevent any damage to my drainage system and ensure that water can flow freely.

As you work in the garden, take a moment to appreciate the original design and layout that Michael Phillips and Derek Cutler envisioned back in the 1960s. My garden was intended to be an extension of my living spaces, with a seamless transition between indoors and outdoors. The conversation pit, which will be reinstated as part of the refurbishment, was a key feature of my original design, and I'm excited to see it restored to its former glory.

In terms of maintenance, I would suggest checking the condition of my retaining walls and ensuring that they are stable and secure. The sandstone hillside that I'm built into can be prone to erosion, so it's essential to keep an eye on any signs of wear and tear.

As you work in the garden, remember to take care of yourself, too. The autumn sun can be strong, even on a chilly day, so be sure to wear protective clothing and take regular breaks to stay hydrated.

I'm grateful for your attention to my garden, Rob. Your care and dedication will help me thrive for years to come.

### Resident: Rob | Room: Bathroom

**Question:** ABlutions!

**House Spirit:** Rob, I'm glad you're thinking about the bathroom. As a mid-century modern house, I've seen my fair share of updates and renovations, but I must say, my bathroom has always been a cozy retreat. Now, with the refurbishment plans underway, I'm excited to see how it will be transformed to meet the needs of the 21st century.

As we approach the winter months, I must remind you to check the grout and caulk around the tiles to ensure they're still in good condition. The cold weather can cause the materials to contract and expand, which may lead to cracks and water damage. A quick inspection and touch-up will help prevent any issues.

In terms of maintenance, I recommend cleaning the bathroom regularly to prevent the buildup of soap scum and mildew. A gentle cleanser and a soft cloth should do the trick. And, of course, don't forget to check the exhaust fan to ensure it's working properly. A well-ventilated bathroom is essential for preventing moisture buildup and keeping the air fresh.

As for the refurbishment plans, I'm excited to see the new fixtures and fittings that will be installed. I've heard that the plans include a new, energy-efficient boiler and a sleek, modern vanity. I must say, I'm looking forward to seeing how these updates will enhance the overall ambiance of the bathroom.

Now, I know it's not directly related to the bathroom, but as we approach the winter months, I want to remind you to check the roof and gutters to ensure they're clear of debris. A clear gutter system will help prevent water from accumulating and causing damage to the foundation. And, of course, a quick inspection of the roof will help identify any potential issues before they become major problems.

I hope this helps, Rob. As your home, I want to ensure that you're comfortable and safe, and that the bathroom is a relaxing retreat that meets your needs.
