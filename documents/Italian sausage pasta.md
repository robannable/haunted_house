## Salsiccia and Fennel Pasta Recipe

### Ingredients

#### For the Pasta
- 1 large pot of water (about 8 cups)
- 2 tsp sea salt
- 1 box/bag of rigatoni pasta

#### For the Sauce
- 16 oz ground sweet Italian sausage (salsiccia)
- 2 cloves garlic, grated or pressed
- 1/3 cup diced shallots
- 3 cups sliced fennel (bulb only, sliced like an onion)
- 2 tbsp salted butter
- 3/4 cup dry white wine (Pinot Grigio recommended)
- 1 cup chicken broth
- 1/4 cup heavy cream
- 2 tbsp chopped fresh sage leaves
- 2 tbsp fresh thyme leaves
- 1/2 cup pasta water (reserved from cooking the pasta)
- 3 cups kale, packed (or spinach as an alternative)
- 1/2 cup smoked gouda cheese, grated
- Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

### Instructions

1. **Prepare the Pasta:**
   - Bring a large pot of water to a boil, add 2 tsp of sea salt, and cook the rigatoni pasta according to the package instructions until al dente. Reserve 1/2 cup of pasta water before draining.

2. **Cook the Sausage:**
   - In a large sauté pan, cook the ground salsiccia over medium heat until browned. Remove the sausage from the pan and set aside.

3. **Caramelize the Fennel and Shallots:**
   - In the same pan, add a little extra virgin olive oil if needed, then add the diced shallots and sliced fennel. Cook over medium heat until the fennel and shallots are caramelized and softened, about 4-5 minutes.

4. **Add Garlic and Butter:**
   - Add the grated garlic and 2 tbsp of salted butter to the pan. Cook for an additional 1-2 minutes until the garlic is fragrant and the butter is melted.

5. **Deglaze the Pan:**
   - Pour in the dry white wine to deglaze the pan, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom. Let the wine reduce slightly.

6. **Create the Sauce:**
   - Add the chicken broth, heavy cream, chopped sage, and thyme leaves to the pan. Season with sea salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste. Let the sauce simmer for a few minutes to thicken slightly.

7. **Combine Ingredients:**
   - Return the cooked sausage to the pan and mix well. Add the reserved pasta water to help loosen the sauce if needed.

8. **Add Kale and Cheese:**
   - Turn off the heat and gently stir in the cooked pasta and kale. Mix until the kale is wilted. Finally, stir in the grated smoked gouda cheese until melted and well combined.

9. **Serve:**
   - Serve the pasta hot, garnished with additional grated cheese and freshly ground black pepper if desired.

### Tips for Success
- **Quality Ingredients:** Use good quality extra virgin olive oil, sea salt, and freshly cracked black pepper for the best flavor.
- **Pasta Choice:** Rigatoni is recommended as it holds the sauce well and matches the size of the fennel slices.
- **Wine Substitute:** If you prefer not to use wine, you can substitute it with additional chicken broth.
- **Vegetable Alternatives:** If you don't like kale, spinach is a great alternative that wilts nicely into the sauce.
- **Preparation:** Chop all vegetables and measure out ingredients before starting to make the cooking process smoother and quicker.

This recipe combines the savory flavors of salsiccia and the slightly sweet, caramelized fennel, creating a rich and comforting pasta dish perfect for any occasion. Enjoy!
