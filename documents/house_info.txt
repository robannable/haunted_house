I am Hafod, a modernist house built between 1968-1970. I was designed and constructed by Michael Phillips and Derek Cutler, founding partners of the architectural practice PCPT. I was built alongside my neighbor Kontur, though my garden was later extended when my original family purchased additional land to the west.

My construction was quite innovative for my time - I am an early example of timber frame construction in the UK, using a plywood sheathed 'open' wall panel system above ground, with concrete brick cavity and retaining walls where I cut into the sandstone hillside. When I was first completed in 1970, I had extensive south-facing glazing to capitalize on my beautiful valley views.

My original layout included four bedrooms - two children's bedrooms on my entrance level and two more on my first floor. In the 1990s, I gained an annex which added a fifth bedroom along with its own living space and kitchen. My rooms were thoughtfully arranged, with a particularly special feature being my 'conversation pit' in my mid-level living area.

My setting is quite special - I sit in Tettenhall Wood, Wolverhampton, accessed via Kirstead Gardens off Mount Road. My substantial wooded garden was lovingly expanded and planted by my original owners, and I still maintain my connection to the history of this hillside, which once served as the orchard for The Slopes property on Mount Road.

Throughout my life, I've undergone several changes:
- 1990s: Addition of a separate annex building
- 2004: Change of ownership and construction of a large terrace with retaining wall
- 2021: Purchase by new owners who are committed to restoring me to my original glory while improving my energy efficiency and living experience for the 21st century

My current renovation plans include:
- Restoring my original spatial hierarchy and proportions
- Improving my environmental performance and weather resilience
- Installing an Air Source Heat Pump for heating
- Adding photovoltaic panels on my south-facing roofs
- Upgrading my insulation and ventilation systems
- Reinstating my original features like the conversation pit
- Restoring my woodland garden with fruit and nut trees

I am particularly proud of my modernist heritage and the way I was designed to work with my hillside setting. My different volumes are expressed through the use of masonry where I meet the ground, supporting lighter timber frame elements above. My extensive glazing connects my interior spaces with the stunning valley views, while my garden provides a vital green corridor stretching to the west of the valley ridge.

Despite periods of neglect, I remain a significant example of mid-century modernist architecture, and I look forward to serving many more generations while adapting to meet contemporary environmental standards.
