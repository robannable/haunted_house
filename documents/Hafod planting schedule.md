# Permaculture Planting Strategy for a South-East Facing Hillside in the Midlands, UK

## Introduction

This planting strategy is designed for a south-east facing hillside in the Midlands, UK. The location offers several advantages:

- South-east aspect provides good morning sunlight
- Hillside location can create microclimates
- Midlands climate is generally moderate, with potential for late frosts

## Planting Layers

### Canopy Layer

- Alder (Alnus glutinosa)
- Siberian Pea Tree (Caragana arborescens)
- Cornelian Cherry (Cornus mas)

**Optimal planting time:** Late autumn to early spring (November to March)

### Climbing Plants

- Jasmine (Jasminum x stephanense)
- Ground Nut (Apios americana)
- Chinese Yam (Dioscorea batatas)
- Passion Flower (Passiflora spp.)
- Kiwi (Actinidia spp.)
- Grape (Vitis vinifera)

**Optimal planting time:** Spring (March to May) for most climbers

### Shrub Layer

- Blackberries / Raspberries
- Plum species
- Bamboos (choose non-invasive varieties)
- Japanese Wineberry (Rubus phoenicolasius)
- Gooseberry (Ribes uva-crispa)
- Currants (Ribes spp.)
- Filberts (Corylus maxima)

**Optimal planting time:** Late autumn to early spring (November to March) for bare-root plants

### Ground Cover

- Creeping Dogwood (Cornus canadensis)
- Campanula persicifolia
- Wild Garlic (Allium ursinum)
- Nepalese Raspberry (Rubus nepalensis)

**Optimal planting time:** Spring (March to May) or autumn (September to October)

### Herbaceous Layer

- Turkish Rocket (Bunias orientalis)
- Campanula glomerata
- Sorrel (Rumex acetosa)
- Miner's Lettuce (Claytonia perfoliata)
- Perennial Buckwheat (Fagopyrum dibotrys)
- Alpine Strawberry (Fragaria vesca)

**Optimal planting time:** Spring (March to May) or autumn (September to October)

### Rhizosphere

- Liquorice (Glycyrrhiza spp.)
- Barberry (Berberis spp.)
- Fungi (Oyster, Shiitake, Lion's Mane)
- Rex Begonia
- Ferns (choose native species)
- Wild Garlic (Allium ursinum)
- Quamash (Camassia quamash)

**Optimal planting time:** Varies by species, but generally spring or autumn

## Planting Considerations for a Hillside in the Midlands

1. **Erosion control:** Use deep-rooted plants like trees and shrubs to stabilize the soil. Implement terracing or swales where appropriate.

2. **Microclimates:** Utilize the hillside to create warm, sheltered areas for less hardy plants. The south-east aspect will provide good morning sun exposure.

3. **Drainage:** Ensure good drainage to prevent waterlogging, especially during wet Midlands winters. Use drought-tolerant plants near the top of the slope.

4. **Frost pockets:** Be aware of potential frost pockets at the bottom of the slope. Plant frost-sensitive species higher up.

5. **Wind protection:** Consider planting windbreaks at the top of the slope to protect more delicate plants.

6. **Access:** Plan paths and terraces for easy maintenance and harvesting.

7. **Soil improvement:** Add organic matter to improve soil structure and water retention, especially on steeper sections.

## Seasonal Planting Guide

### Spring (March - May)

- Plant most herbaceous plants and ground covers
- Sow seeds for annual vegetables
- Plant out tender climbers after the last frost (usually mid-May in the Midlands)

### Summer (June - August)

- Maintain and harvest existing plants
- Plant drought-tolerant species if necessary

### Autumn (September - November)

- Plant trees and shrubs
- Divide and replant perennials
- Sow green manures on empty areas

### Winter (December - February)

- Plan for the coming year
- Plant bare-root trees and shrubs during mild spells
- Prune dormant trees and shrubs

## Conclusion

This permaculture planting strategy takes advantage of the south-east facing hillside in the Midlands to create a diverse and productive ecosystem. By considering the specific conditions of the site and following the optimal planting times, you can establish a resilient and bountiful permaculture garden that works with the natural landscape.
